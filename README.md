# PixelWalk
This JavaScript code is a color picker that allows a user to select a color from an image by clicking on it. The selected color is then used to draw a path around all pixels in the image that are of a similar color. 

This is not a robust script. There are edge cases where it will fail, that is why the image provided is relatively simple and the elements do not intersect with the edge of the image.
